# SSL Directory

This directory is for SSL certificates.
Place your SSL certificate files here if you want to enable HTTPS.

Files you might want to add:

- server.crt (SSL certificate)
- server.key (Private key)
- dhparam.pem (Diffie-Hellman parameters)

Make sure to update nginx.conf to include SSL configuration when you add certificates.
